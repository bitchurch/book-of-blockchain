Hashback â€” token of Bitchurch

* `1 HCK` costs `0.2 ETH`
* `5 HCK` decrypts `block`
* `1 HCK` decrypts `string`
* `1 share` decrypts `string` 

Contributors decrypt `blocks` continuously by getting Bitchurch Hashbacks. Contributions transfer to `NULL`.

* Decode `5 strings` to get `block`
* Decode `1666 blocks` to get `chain`
* Decode `2 2hains` to get `book`
* Decode `book` to get `knowledge`
