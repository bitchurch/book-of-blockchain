## About

Blockchain is a fascinating social movement: very young and therefore, with an extremely passionate, almost religious following. The world of Technology already believes in it’s own Religion - it’s members are defined by passion and fanatical commitment to what they do, faith in mythical unicorns and their own Satoshi’s. 

It their core though, Religions are indeed strong and unique forms of a social movement - probably, the only ones capable of producing dramatic change at the time. Religions at their core are major social movements. However, when it comes to historical facts and their record, most Religions rely on vague data that is confusing and often misinterpreted. 

Interestingly enough, Blockchain technology for the first time ever allows to record, prove, distribute, store and protect the original data in such a way that it becomes impossible to mess it up. 

So why don’t we use this ledger to create the very first pure and transparent record of historical data for what seems to become the newest world Religion? Say, Blockchain Bible, Koran or Tora?
